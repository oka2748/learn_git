Algorithm CheckpointAlgorithm
Input: sentence (string)
Output: length (integer), wordCount (integer), vowelCount (integer)

Variables:
    length <- 0
    wordCount <- 0
    vowelCount <- 0

For each character in the sentence:
    Increment length by 1

    If the character is a letter:
        If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U):
            Increment vowelCount by 1

    If the character is a space:
        Increment wordCount by 1

Output length, wordCount, and vowelCount
